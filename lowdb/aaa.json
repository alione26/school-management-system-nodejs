      "longDescription": "Four career cons just committed the crime of the century. But when a double-cross leaves their loot in limbo, it’s up to one American temptress (Jamie Lee Curtis) to convince one English lawyer (John Cleese) to reveal its location. Monty Python veteran John Cleese co-wrote and co-stars in this hilarious tale of lust, sex, murder and seafood, which won an Academy Award for Kevin Kline for his performance as an unhinged hitman. Also starring Python veteran Michael Palin, A Fish Called Wanda is “a deliciously dishy comedy” (Washington Post)."

      "longDescription": "With her first and only feature film—a hard-luck drama she wrote, directed, and starred in—Barbara Loden turned in a groundbreaking work of American independent cinema, bringing to life a kind of character seldom seen on-screen. Set amid a soot-choked Pennsylvania landscape, and shot in an intensely intimate vérité style, the film takes up with distant and soft-spoken Wanda (Loden), who has left her husband, lost custody of her children, and now finds herself alone, drifting between dingy bars and motels, where she falls prey to a series of callous men—including a bank robber who ropes her into his next criminal scheme. An until now difficult-to-see masterpiece that has nonetheless exerted an outsize influence on generations of artists and filmmakers, Wanda is a compassionate and wrenching portrait of a woman stranded on society’s margins."
