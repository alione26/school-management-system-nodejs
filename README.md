# Prerequisite Knowledge
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and ofc Expressjs (Nodejs)

# Before you run

Make sure you have already installed [Nodejs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### In the cmd prompt, powershell
Run this `npm install`, it may take time to finish.

Create a file named `.env` with `cookie_secret=anything`

Then `npm start`, then all done!
