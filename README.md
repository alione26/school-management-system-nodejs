Hi there! 
Contact me: katyperrycbt@gmail.com

# Prerequisite Knowledge
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and ofc Expressjs (Nodejs)

# Before you run

Make sure you have already installed [Nodejs](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), [Expressjs](http://expressjs.com/).

### In the cmd prompt, powershell
Run this `npm install`, it may take time to finish.

Create a file named `.env` with the content: `cookie_secret=anything` 

(Note: 'anything' means any string you prefer. Learn more: [cookie-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser))

Then `npm start`, then all done!
